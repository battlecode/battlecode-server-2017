Battlecode Server
---


BUILDING

NOTE: If you are a competitor, you can download the installer that does all these steps for you. See http://www.battlecode.org/contestants/releases/.

You have to build the server before the client. This process builds both. You need an existing battlecode distribution for the updated jogl.jar file, and everything else.

1. cd into your workspace
2. git clone https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode-server.git
3. cd battlecode-server
4. mkdir -p ~/.ant/lib
5. ant download-ivy
6. ant retrieve
7. ant jar
8. mkdir battlecode_distro
9. cp battlecode-server.jar battlecode_distro/
10. cd ..
11. git clone https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode-client.git
12. cd battlecode-client
13. ant retrieve
14. cp ../battlecode-server/battlecode-server.jar lib/
15. cp ../battlecode-server/battlecode_distro/jogl.jar lib/
16. ant jar
17. cp battlecode-client.jar battlecode_distro/

Enjoy your new build!
