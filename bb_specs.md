Battlecode Bloomberg Prize
==============================

The Bloomberg Prize will be awarded to the team that wins a special competition with an emphasis on awesome navigation.

Intro
---------------
Have any of you been working a bit too hard trying to perfect that A* routine? Or perhaps you already have the best run and gun routines no opponents can handle, and you're looking for the next challenge. Perhaps your team has even given up on eternal glory.

Well, no matter where you are in your 4 week Battlecode career, we have a new refreshing challenge just for you. Bloomberg wants to see if you can navigate their challenge maps, and is giving out a sponsor prize for anyone who can get close. You can expect their challenge maps to have some of the hardest terrain, the most dead ends, and a guarantee that naïve bugging code will just not work. If you can navigate their map all the way to the enemy HQ the fastest and destroy it, though, you can be assured a spot on that pedestal of eternal glory.

Oh and in case you were wondering, we've heard that there were some pretty heavy winds on the Bloomberg maps, and drones seems to be careening wildly out of control. And that HQ, well, it seems to have some crazy attacks and regeneration stats.

How to Enter
---------------

To enter this tournament, upload a bot on Thursday, 1/29. The submission window will be open all day (Eastern time). If you do not upload anything we will use your regular tournament submission.

The prize will be awarded by Bloomberg during the Battlecode Final Tournament on 1/31.

Details
---------------
The following details are tentative but will be finalized by the end of Monday, 1/26.

All rules will be the same as the regular Battlecode, except:
- No drones can be spawned.
- You will be scored based on how quickly you destroy the enemy HQ. Destroying towers will give partial credit.
- Maps will be challenging to navigate and might not be symmetric.
- There is no upper bound to the round limit (it might be well over 3000).
- Your opponent will be a bot that does not spawn any units, but might attack with TOWERs and HQ.
